In this program, I created a dynamic memory allocator. Instead of using the built-in one provided by glibc. This allocator utilizes an explicit free list and also provide information on the current state of your memory allocator.

Take Aways from this assignment
1. inner workings of how a dynamic memory allocator operates
2. framgnetation and how/where they occur
3. memory padding and alignment
4. working with structs and linked lists in C
5. woKRING WITH errno numbers in C
6. Linking with other object files
7. Unit testing in C
